Hostel Management System

Project Statement:
Hostel management system offers a full featured accommodation system to efficiently manage the entire residential facility in the university of college. Reducing the staff & paper works, this accommodation software will keep the updated records of students, their meal, lodging, transfer room and other facilities. The software allocates rooms to the registered students based on their preferences and records their details of using food, lodging and other facilities along with fee and other advance payment details. The system also gathers a feedback on the room, food and other amenities on a regular basis and sends fee reminders to all registered students. This hostel management system monitors attendance, disciplinary logs, room charge status and check-in check-out in hostel premises.
